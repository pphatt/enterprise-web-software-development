- **Repository Pattern**: Encapsulates data access logic into reusable, testable repositories, abstracting the underlying database.
- **Unit of Work**: Coordinates multiple repository operations into a single transaction, ensuring data consistency across changes.
- **Cron Job**: Schedules recurring tasks, such as checking for contributions without comments after 14 days and triggering exception reports.
- **JWT Token**: Secures API endpoints with JSON Web Tokens, enforcing role-based access via authentication and authorization.
- **Event-Driven Design**: Guarantees reliable email notifications to Marketing Coordinators using an outbox pattern with RabbitMQ for asynchronous event handling.
- **.NET Core Web API**: Delivers lightweight, RESTful endpoints with ASP.NET Core 8, maximizing efficiency and client compatibility.
